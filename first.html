  <p> Traveling is something really unique, and there are only so many things we can learn in a school environment. Travel really can't be taught; you can learn about other cultures, but you can't be fully taught unless you experience it. Scientifically, it is shown that traveling also gains you more confidence and a great way to develop cultural sensitivity. Not to mention if you travel abroad, you can most likely be submerged into a second or third language.</p>
